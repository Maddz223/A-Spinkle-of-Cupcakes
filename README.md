## Project Overview

The website is designed to be a simple, fast-loading static site with the following features:

- A homepage with a brief introduction.
- A portfolio section showcasing past projects.
- A contact form for potential clients to reach out (static form, no backend).
- A responsive design optimized for both mobile and desktop screens.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- **HTML**: For creating the basic structure of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling the website and making it responsive.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons and vector images.
- **Google Fonts**: For custom fonts.

## Installation

To run this website locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-static-website.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd my-static-website
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file:**
   Simply double-click on the `index.html` file, and it will open in your default browser. Alternatively, use a live server to preview the site.

4. **Optional - Start a Local Server:**
   If you prefer to run a local server, you can use tools like [VS Code Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or any other simple HTTP server:

   Using Python:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

   Now open the browser and visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

To customize this static website, follow these instructions:

1. **Homepage**: Edit the `index.html` file to update the homepage content, including the introduction and main section.
2. **Portfolio**: Modify the `portfolio.html` file to showcase your projects. Add or remove sections as needed.
3. **Contact Form**: The contact form is currently a static form, but you can link it to a backend service (like Formspree or Google Forms) to handle submissions. For now, it does not send emails directly.
4. **Styling**: Customize the website's appearance by editing the `styles.css` file. Modify colors, fonts, and layout to suit your preferences.

## Deployment

You can deploy this website on any platform that supports static websites, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. Here's how to deploy it on **GitHub Pages**:

1. Push your changes to your GitHub repository.
2. Go to the repository on GitHub and click on the **Settings** tab.
3. Scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section.
4. Under **Source**, select `main` branch and `root` folder.
5. GitHub will provide you with a URL to access your deployed website.

Alternatively, you can deploy the site on **Netlify** by following these steps:

1. Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and create an account.
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify.
3. Select the repository and click **Deploy Site**.

Netlify will automatically deploy your website and provide a custom domain.

## Troubleshooting

Here are a few common issues and solutions:

- **Website not showing up correctly**: If images or styles are not loading, make sure all files (images, CSS, JS) are in the correct folder and have the correct paths.
- **Contact form not working**: The form is currently static and does not submit. To enable form submission, you can link it to an email service like [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) or use a backend service.
- **Responsive issues**: If the website looks weird on some screen sizes, ensure you have correctly set up media queries in `styles.css` for mobile responsiveness.
